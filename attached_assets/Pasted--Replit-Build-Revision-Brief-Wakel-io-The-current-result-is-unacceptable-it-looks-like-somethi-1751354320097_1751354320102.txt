📣 Replit Build Revision Brief – Wakel.io
The current result is unacceptable — it looks like something built by a beginner or an AI template generator with zero understanding of branding, structure, or execution. This is not acceptable for a company offering agency representation for global AI products.

🔁 What went wrong:
Only one page was built despite my detailed prompt calling for bilingual multi-page layout (/ and /ar) with full section breakdown.

All elements look generic and lazy: stock buttons, meaningless photos, soulless layout. Nothing about this site communicates the trust, expertise, or regional insight that Wakel.io stands for.

Logo was ignored — I am attaching a logo that must be used.

Color palette and typography were not respected as per original instructions.

🛠 What needs to be rebuilt — properly this time:
✅ Use This Logo
Use this exact image as the main logo:
[Attach: Wakel.io logo → A_digital_vector_logo_design_features_the_word_"Wa.png]
It must appear top-left in the navbar on both English and Arabic versions.

✅ Required Pages
/ → English homepage (LTR)

/ar → Arabic homepage (RTL)

✅ Section Structure (Both Languages)
Hero Section (Tagline + CTA)

✅ Reminder: This site must feel designed by a senior product team — not an AI slapped-together template.
The message is trust, expertise, and regional business fluency — not generic SaaS.
Revisit the full prompt I gave you and rebuild accordingly.
